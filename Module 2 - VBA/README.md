# Bryan Johnson's GWU Module 2 VBA Assignment READ ME File

## The files for this assignment can be found at the following repo: 
https://github.com/bryanpijohnson/GWU-DS-course-files/tree/main/Module%202%20-%20VBA

This link will also be shared as the submission within the course

## Within the repo link, you will find the following folders and files to be reviewed and graded:

- **README.md** - that is this file. :)
- **VBA Code.xlsm** - this is a Macro-enabled file that holds both the macro code within the cells of the workbook, but also has the macro script saved within the Visual Basic editor.
- **VBA Code.vba** - this is the VBA file required by the assignment. It has the macro code pasted within the cells of the workbook.
- **Screenshots** - this folder is where the screenshots requested are housed. The following files are in this folder.
  - Since it was unclear what screenshots needed to be taken, I've taken a screenshot of each sheet in both workbooks (_alphabetical_testing.xls_ and _multiple_year_stock_data.xls_) as well as a screenshot of part of the VBA macro.
- The **IGNORE** folder should be ignored as it holds the other files I used while working on the assignment.
